The FTP client allows you to connect to the server quickly, securely and conveniently via the **SFTP protocol**. 🌐

⚙️You can easily manage your files and folders, view their sizes, and transfer them between your local system and the server. 
Thanks to the user interface, the user has the ability to upload and download files from the server intuitively.🔨It is possible to adjust the settings through a convenient configuration window and to create and change profiles saved in the **.json** file. 📁

☁ A convenient way of saving connection strings in the history page allows you to quickly set the required information.

🧰The project was created with the help of **repository pattern**, **dependency injection** and **MVVM**.
